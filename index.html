                                Ask any trader and he will say that the most exciting time to trade stocks is with no doubt, 
                                “The Earning Season”. Every quarter (3 months) all public traded companies will publish their EPS 
                                (Earnings Per Share) for the previous quarter. This period is exciting because we can take a glimpse 
                                into each company’s reports. The insights help us plan our trades and enjoy positive and negative market 
                                reactions while trading on stocks we are all familiar with.
